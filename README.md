# Sample-exam-Solution-IBM-Certified-Associate-Developer--Qiskit-v0.2X

### Hello Qiskitter!! I have recently taken the Certification exam and and this is the solution to the sample exam.This has been prepared in IBMQ Experience so you might want to use that instead of your local environment for avoiding conflicting versions and access to all widgets easily etc.

## Here are the subjects you will be presented with, in the exam

An IBM Qiskit Developer is an individual who demonstrates fundamental knowledge of quantum computing concepts and is able to express them using the Qiskit open source software development kit (SDK). They have experience using the Qiskit SDK from the Python programming language to create and execute quantum computing programs on IBM Quantum computers and simulators.

Key areas of competency:
Defining, executing, and visualizing results of quantum circuits using the Qiskit SDK
Understanding single-qubit gates and their rotations on the Bloch sphere.
Understanding various multi-qubit gates and their effects in quantum circuits.
Leveraging fundamental Qiskit SDK features including commonly-used classes and functions located in qiskit.circuit, qiskit.execute, qiskit.providers, qiskit.qasm, qiskit.quantum_info, qiskit.tools, and qiskit.visualization packages.

During exam development, the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) define all of the tasks, knowledge and experience that an individual would need in order to successfully fulfill their role with the product or solution. These are represented by the objectives below and the questions on the certification exam are based upon these objective.
